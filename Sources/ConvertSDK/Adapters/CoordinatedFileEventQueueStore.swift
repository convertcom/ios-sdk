// CoordinatedFileEventQueueStore.swift
// Concrete `EventQueueStore` adapter (Epic 5, Story 5.2): persists the pending
// tracking-event queue to disk via the owned `CoordinatedFileStore`
// (`NSFileCoordinator` + atomic writes), adding the Codable layer + corruption
// recovery on top. Lives in the `ConvertSDK` (platform) target because it depends
// on Foundation file I/O via `CoordinatedFileStore`; the pure-logic
// `ConvertSDKCore` must NOT import it.

import Foundation
import ConvertSDKCore

/// Durable, coordinated persistence for the pending tracking-event queue — the production
/// ``EventQueueStore`` (FR51 / NFR13).
///
/// It is a thin Codable wrapper that DELEGATES every raw file operation to an owned
/// ``CoordinatedFileStore`` (itself an `actor`), so the actual disk I/O — and the single
/// `NSFileCoordinator` usage — lives in exactly ONE place. This adapter therefore neither
/// imports nor references `NSFileCoordinator` directly; the atomic-write semantics and the
/// intermediate-directory creation both come for free from the delegate.
///
/// ── Why `final actor` (not `@unchecked Sendable` class) ───────────────────────────────────
/// Modeled as a `public final actor` so it is `Sendable` and data-race-clean under Swift 6
/// strict concurrency with NO `@unchecked` suppression — the actor serializes all in-process
/// access to its operations. The delegated ``CoordinatedFileStore`` wraps `NSFileCoordinator`,
/// the forward-compatible OS-file-lock seam (R1 / NFR14): when the queue later lives in a
/// shared App Group (so an extension can flush events too), coordinated reads/writes already
/// arbitrate concurrent access between processes. The actor handles the in-process seam; the
/// coordinator handles the cross-process one.
///
/// ── Why `.useDefaultKeys` (AR13) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// The ``JSONEncoder`` is pinned to `.useDefaultKeys` and NEVER `.convertToSnakeCase`:
/// ``TrackingEvent`` declares explicit camelCase `CodingKeys`, so snake_case keys must never
/// leak onto disk (or, after a flush, onto the wire). The decoder likewise uses default keys —
/// the persisted file round-trips byte-for-byte with the wire payload.
///
/// ── Why corruption degrades to `[]` and NEVER throws (FR51 / NFR13) ────────────────────────
/// A file that exists but fails to decode (bad/garbled bytes) is discarded — ``load()`` logs a
/// WARN through the ``Logger`` port, deletes the file, and returns `[]`. The SDK degrades to an
/// empty queue rather than crashing on bad bytes. A MISSING file (normal first launch, or the
/// state right after a successful flush cleared it) is distinct: it returns `[]` SILENTLY, with
/// NO warn — it is not an error, just an empty queue.
