// MockCorePorts.swift
// Test-double conformances for the ConvertSDKCore *persistence* ports consumed by the
// Epic 3 / Story 1 visitor-context suite: `SecureStore`, `KeyValueStore`, and `Logger`.
//
// ── Why a SEPARATE file from Tests/ConvertSDKTests/Support/MockPorts.swift ─────────────
// The two test targets cannot share code: `ConvertSDKCoreTests` depends ONLY on
// `ConvertSDKCore` (Package.swift), while `MockPorts.swift` lives in `ConvertSDKTests`
// (which depends on `ConvertSDK`) and is therefore invisible here. The mocks below
// conform to the *Core* port protocols (`SecureStore`/`KeyValueStore`/`Logger`), which are
// reachable through the `ConvertSDKCore` dependency. `MockLogger` is re-declared here for
// the same visibility reason — the `ConvertSDKTests` one cannot be seen from this target.
//
// ── Concurrency shape per mock ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// All three ports refine `Sendable`, so every mock must be `Sendable`. Their requirements
// are SYNCHRONOUS — `read/write/delete` are sync `throws`, `string/set/removeObject` and
// `log(...)` are sync — which an `actor` CANNOT satisfy (actor access is `async`). So each
// mock is a `final class` whose entire mutable state lives in a single `LockedBox` cell,
// exactly as `MockPorts.swift` documents for its synchronous mocks (`MockLogger`/`MockClock`).
//
// `Mutex<Value>` from `Synchronization` — the annotation-free `Sendable` lock-cell — is NOT
// available: it needs macOS 15 / iOS 18, but this package targets macOS 12 / iOS 15
// (Package.swift `platforms`). At that floor the only way a `final class` with lock-guarded
// mutable state can claim `Sendable` is to assert it. `@unchecked Sendable` is forbidden by
// project policy; the sanctioned form is `nonisolated(unsafe)` on the guarded storage, and
// that single annotation is confined to the one `LockedBox` primitive below — the mocks
// themselves carry ZERO suppressions.
//
// `file_length` is disabled file-wide (a single named rule — NOT `disable all`): this is the shared
// Core-port mock aggregator for the whole `ConvertSDKCoreTests` target — persistence ports
// (`SecureStore`/`KeyValueStore`/`Logger`/`FileStore`), the `EventSink` seam, and the Story 5.1
// `EventUploader`/`Clock` doubles — and the file crossed the 400-line default only when the event-queue
// mocks were appended (the suite mandates appending here, not splitting into a new support file).
// Scattering these co-located mocks across files to shave a handful of lines would fragment the
// test-support surface for no readability gain; all other rules remain enforced. Mirrors the file-wide
// `file_length` disable convention in `Tests/ConvertSDKTests/Support/TestFixtures.swift`.
