// Tests/ConvertSDKTests/ConvertContextRunExperiencesTests.swift
// `@testable` import (the established pattern — see `ConvertSDKTests.swift` / `ConvertContextTests.swift`
// headers): this suite reaches the SDK's INTERNAL surface so a separate test target can see `internal`
// members. It lives in its OWN file (not appended to `ConvertContextTests.swift`) because that file is
// already ~336 lines and adding this suite would push it over SwiftLint's `file_length` (400) limit —
// a new file is cleaner than compressing the existing one. The multi-experience FIXTURE this suite
// builds on (`makeMultiExperienceConfig`) lives in `Support/TestFixtures.swift` alongside the
// single-experience `makeExperienceConfig` it twins.
//
// ── Story 3.5 (Epic 3) RED phase ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Asserts the REAL behaviour the GREEN step must produce when it replaces the
// `runExperiences(enableTracking:)` STUB (which returns `[]` UNCONDITIONALLY) with a wired
// `ExperienceManager.selectVariations(...)` delegation. The contract GREEN implements:
//   * read the config snapshot from the SDK's `ConfigStore`; a `nil` snapshot (pre-ready / no config)
//     → return `[]` WITHOUT touching the manager;
//   * otherwise delegate to `ExperienceManager.selectVariations(in:visitorId:accountId:projectId:
//     attributes:locationProperties:enableTracking:)`, returning its `[Variation]` verbatim — which is
//     every eligible experience's bucketed variation in CONFIG ORDER; never throw.
//
// Three of these tests FAIL against the current stub — that compile-passing, runtime-failing state is
// the correct RED signal for a WIRING task (cleaner than a compile-fail): the suite calls only the
// EXISTING public surface (`ConvertSDK(...)`, `ready()`, `createContext`, `runExperiences`) plus the
// new `makeMultiExperienceConfig` fixture, so it COMPILES today; the assertions on a non-empty,
// concretely-ordered `[Variation]` are what the `[]`-returning stub cannot satisfy.
//   * `runExperiencesPreReadyReturnsEmpty` — PASSES today (the stub returns `[]`, which is ALSO the
//     wired no-snapshot answer), pinning the degraded path across the wiring change.
//   * `runExperiencesReadyReturnsAllVariations` + `runExperiencesPreservesConfigOrder` +
//     `runExperiencesDefaultArgMatchesExplicitTrue` — FAIL today (stub returns `[]` ⇒ `count == 3`,
//     the ordered-keys equality, and the default-vs-explicit equivalence all fail); they pass once the
//     real `ExperienceManager` delegation is wired.
//
// ── Why RETURN VALUES only (no enqueue-count asserts) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ConvertSDK` wires its OWN internal `EventSink` inside `ExperienceManager.makeDefault(...)`; it is
// NOT injectable through the `createContext` seam (documented in `ConvertContextTests.swift` ~L246-249
// for the `runExperience` wiring suite). So this suite asserts RETURN VALUES only — count, config
// order, the pre-ready-empty degraded path, and default-argument equivalence. The exactly-once enqueue
// (and its tracking-off suppression) is covered at the `ExperienceManager` level by a separate suite;
// THIS suite owns the public-API `runExperiences` RETURN-VALUE contract.
