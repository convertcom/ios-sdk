// MockPorts.swift
// Test-double conformances for the five inward-facing ConvertSDKCore ports
// (`HTTPClient`, `EventSink`, `FileStore`, `Logger`, `Clock`), consumed by the
// Epic 2–5 test suites. This file is a COMPILATION STUB for Story 1.3 (AC8/AC9):
// it carries no behavior tests of its own — the smoke test lives elsewhere — but
// it MUST compile zero-warning under Swift 6 strict concurrency (language mode 6).
//
// ── Concurrency shape per mock (AC9) ──────────────────────────────────────────
// All five ports refine `Sendable`, so every mock must be `Sendable`. Two
// compiler-blessed shapes are used, chosen by whether the port's requirements are
// `async`:
//
//   * `actor` — `MockHTTPClient`, `MockEventSink`, `MockFileStore`. Every
//     requirement on these ports is `async`, so an actor satisfies them with the
//     compiler fully reasoning about isolation: NO `@unchecked Sendable`, NO
//     `nonisolated(unsafe)`, NO lock.
//   * `final class` + `LockedBox` — `MockLogger`, `MockClock`. Their requirements
//     are SYNCHRONOUS (`func log(...)`, `var now: Date { get }`), which an actor
//     cannot satisfy (actor access is async). Their mutable state is held in a
//     single `LockedBox` cell (see below).
//
// `Mutex<Value>` from `Synchronization` — the modern lock-cell that the compiler
// accepts as `Sendable` with mutable contents and needs no annotation — is NOT
// available here: it requires macOS 15 / iOS 18, but this package targets
// macOS 12 / iOS 15 (see Package.swift `platforms`). At that deployment floor the
// only way a `final class` with lock-guarded mutable state can claim `Sendable`
// is to assert it to the compiler. `@unchecked Sendable` is forbidden by project
// policy; the sanctioned last-resort form is `nonisolated(unsafe)` on the guarded
// storage. That single annotation is confined to the one `LockedBox` primitive
// below — the synchronous mocks themselves contain zero suppressions, and the
// shared cell also removes the copy-paste lock/accessor block that would
// otherwise repeat across them.
