// Tests/ConvertSDKTests/ConvertContextRunFeaturesTests.swift
// `@testable` import (the established pattern — see `ConvertContextRunExperiencesTests.swift`):
// this suite reaches the SDK's INTERNAL surface so a separate test target can see `internal`
// members. It lives in its OWN file (mirroring the run-experiences suite) to keep the feature
// wiring concern separate from the experience wiring concern. The single-feature FIXTURE this
// suite builds on (`makeFeatureConfig`) lives in `Support/TestFixtures.swift` alongside the
// `makeExperienceConfig` / `makeMultiExperienceConfig` builders it twins.
//
// ── Story 4.1 (Epic 4) RED phase ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Asserts the REAL behaviour the WIRING step must produce when it routes the
// `runFeature(_:)` / `runFeatures()` STUBS (which return
// `Feature(id:"", key:key, status:.disabled, variables:[:])` and `[]` UNCONDITIONALLY) to a
// wired `FeatureManager` over the SDK's config snapshot. The contract the wiring implements:
//   * read the config snapshot from the SDK; a `nil` snapshot (pre-ready / no config) → a DISABLED
//     feature (resp. `[]`) WITHOUT touching the manager;
//   * otherwise delegate to `FeatureManager.evaluateFeature(...)` / `evaluateAllFeatures(...)`,
//     enabling a feature the visitor buckets into and surfacing its typed variables; never throw.
//
// Two of these tests FAIL against the current stub — that compile-passing, runtime-failing state is
// the correct RED signal for a WIRING task (cleaner than a compile-fail): the suite calls only the
// EXISTING public surface (`ConvertSDK(...)`, `ready()`, `createContext`, `runFeature`,
// `runFeatures`) plus the new `makeFeatureConfig` fixture, so it COMPILES today; the assertions on an
// `.enabled` feature (with typed variables) and a non-empty result are what the disabled/`[]`-returning
// stubs cannot satisfy.
//   * `runFeaturePreReadyReturnsDisabled` + `runFeaturesPreReadyReturnsEmpty` — PASS today (the stubs
//     return disabled / `[]`, which is ALSO the wired no-snapshot answer), pinning the degraded path
//     across the wiring change.
//   * `runFeatureReadyEnablesCarriedFeature` + `runFeaturesReadyReturnsEnabledFeature` — FAIL today
//     (the stubs return `.disabled` / `[]`), the expected RED signal; the real `FeatureManager`
//     delegation enables the bucketed feature and surfaces its variables.
//
// ── Why RETURN VALUES only (no enqueue-count asserts) ────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ConvertSDK` wires its OWN internal `EventSink` behind `FeatureManager` (which itself delegates
// bucketing — and therefore the `.bucketing` fire — to `ExperienceManager`); the sink is NOT
// injectable through the `createContext` seam (documented for the sibling run-experiences suite). So
// this suite asserts RETURN VALUES only — feature status, typed variables, and the pre-ready-degraded
// path. The bucketing/enqueue contract is covered at the
// `FeatureManager` / `ExperienceManager` level by separate suites; THIS suite owns the public-API
// `runFeature` / `runFeatures` RETURN-VALUE contract.
